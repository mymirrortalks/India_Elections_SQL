- **Columns:** `S_No`, `Parliament_Constituency`, `Constituency_Name`, `Winning_Candidate`, `Total_Votes`, `Margin`, `Constituency_ID`, `Party_ID`

### **3️⃣ partywise_results**
- Displays party-wise seat count.
- **Columns:** `Party`, `Won`, `Party_ID`

### **4️⃣ states**
- Maps constituencies to states.
- **Columns:** `State_ID`, `State`

## 🔍 Key SQL Queries for Analysis
### 🏆 Winning Trends
#### 1️⃣ Find the party that won the most seats:
```sql
SELECT Party, COUNT(Won) AS SeatsWon FROM partywise_results GROUP BY Party ORDER BY SeatsWon DESC;
```
#### 2️⃣ Highest margin victories:
```sql
SELECT Constituency_Name, Winning_Candidate, Margin FROM constituencywise_results ORDER BY Margin DESC LIMIT 10;
```

### 📊 Voter Turnout & Participation
#### 3️⃣ Constituencies with highest voter turnout:
```sql
SELECT Constituency_Name, SUM(Total_Votes) AS TotalVotes FROM constituencywise_results GROUP BY Constituency_Name ORDER BY TotalVotes DESC LIMIT 10;
```
#### 4️⃣ Party-wise total votes received:
```sql
SELECT Party, SUM(Total_Votes) AS TotalVotes FROM constituencywise_details GROUP BY Party ORDER BY TotalVotes DESC;
```

### 🌍 State-Wise Analysis
#### 5️⃣ State with the highest average winning margin:
```sql
SELECT s.State, AVG(Margin) AS AvgWinningMargin FROM constituencywise_results c JOIN states s ON c.Constituency_ID = s.State_ID GROUP BY s.State ORDER BY AvgWinningMargin DESC LIMIT 5;
```
#### 6️⃣ Leading and trailing candidates in each state:
```sql
SELECT s.State, c.Constituency_Name, c.Leading_Candidate, c.Trailing_Candidate FROM statewise_results c JOIN states s ON c.State_ID = s.State_ID ORDER BY s.State;
```
