## üîç Key SQL Queries for Analysis
### üèÜ Winning Trends
#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Find the party that won the most seats:

```

### üåç State-Wise Analysis
#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ State with the highest average winning margin:
```sql
SELECT s.State, AVG(Margin) AS AvgWinningMargin FROM constituencywise_results c JOIN states s ON c.Constituency_ID = s.State_ID GROUP BY s.State ORDER BY AvgWinningMargin DESC LIMIT 5;
```
#### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Leading and trailing candidates in each state:
```sql
SELECT s.State, c.Constituency_Name, c.Leading_Candidate, c.Trailing_Candidate FROM statewise_results c JOIN states s ON c.State_ID = s.State_ID ORDER BY s.State;
